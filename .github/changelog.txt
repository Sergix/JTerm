	Edited "Ps" and "Ping" classes for function names and option processing. Original credit goes to @chromechris for writing these methods.
	Wrote docs for v0.4.0 and compiled binaries and other dependencies.
	EventHandler() is currently unneeded, so it has been removed.
	Included a wrapfile in the build/src/ directory for the release. More info in the documentation.

	Fixed two output prompt issue presented in last changelog entry.
	First issue in issue list in the last changelog entry is now irrelevant, as the "pause" command no longer uses the EventHandler
	for input.
	User input reader moved to global static variable (JTerm.userInput) to avoid having multiple readers for System.in open.
	TODO in Exec(), line 162 (!)
	Pushed updates to Git.

(#56)[6/16/2017-23:15 0.3.1 Sergix]
	Fixed pause key listener.
	Known issues:
		- When pressing a key during pause, that key is read and automatically passed to the BufferedReader in the command loop; it is able to be backspaced,
			but doing so and then entering more characters crashes the program.
		- (Linked with above issue) Hitting enter for a pause command outputs two command input prompts and an extra newline before

(#55)[6/15/2017-19:39 0.3.1 Sergix]
	Moved all event handlers to new EventHandler class.
	Initialized from EventHandler.init() called in main().

(#52)[6/12/2017-14:52 0.3.0 Sergix]

	Updated source builds and JAR builds.
	Created version changelog and release notes.

(#48)[6/11/2017-15:46 0.3.0 Sergix]

(#44)[5/31/2017-23:28 0.2.1 Sergix]
	Created a "Server" class that can run a socket server directly from JTerm and accepts multiple client requests.
	Soon, this will become programmable through scripts.
	Server.Start() is the used function.
	Threads are used to keep track of connecting users.
	Only issues are:
		- Loops cannot be used to receive input on the server side; the connection must be immediately severed after recieving a message
		- Server close code is unreachable
	Pushed updates to Git.

(#43)[5/31/2017-20:43 0.2.1 Sergix]
	Created a "Client" class that can connect to open TCP servers using a specified port and IP address.

	Edited README with small changes and a new "Versioning" section.
	Version numbers now implement the "Semantic Versioning" specification (see README for details.)
	Changed the name of the pre-release jar to "jterm-v0.1.0.jar" to align with this specification.
	Updated the jar file in the GitHub "release"->"Prerelease" section on the project site.
	Changelog entries's version number has now changed from "pre-alpha" to "0.1.0". This doesn't admit any notable changes.
	Changelog entries (if not beforehand specified) must use the version number of the last released build. This is because we don't know if the next build will end up being a major, minor, or patch release, so it only seems logical to do this.
	Changed the format of build "src" and "changelog" files, as now specified in the README update. It only made sense that the naming conventions of all files published in a build remain similar.
	Edited the filenames of the pre-release build files. "vPrerelease-changelog.txt" -> "jterm-changelog-v0.1.0.txt"; "vPrerelease-src.zip" -> "jterm-src-v0.1.0.zip".
	Pushed updates to Git.

(#21)[5/23/2017-21:57 pre-alpha Sergix]

	Pushed updates to Git.

(#20)[5/23/2017-20:48 pre-alpha Sergix]

	Pushed updates to Git.

(#18)[5/23/2017-16:32 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Add "dir" to runnable commands in JTerm class.
	Command syntax: dir [directory]

	Running Travis builds at the moment. I have requested for review to merge the PR (#2) if successful.
	Pushed updates to Git.

(#17)[5/23/2017-8:40 pre-alpha Sergix]

	Changed .gitignore to reject .class files.
	Pushed updates to Git.

(#14)[5/19/2017-19:47 pre-alpha Sergix]

	Added the compile.sh file for CI build scripts.
	Updated .travis.yml to work with the new parameters.
	Changed README to include build status image from Travis CI.
	Pushed updates to Git.

(#13)[5/18/2017-17:23 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Attempting a different CI: CircleCI.
	Already started building the project... hopefully everything sails smoothly.
	Obviously, however, all issues are coming from Maven/Gradle, and I still cannot understand how to format the Maven POM or the build.gradle.
	There MUST be an easier way to deploy Java projects.... If anyone has any insight into this I am open to any suggestions.
	I'm probably going to give up on CI though. It's definitely nice for large projects, but Java does not seem to want to work with my CI.
	Removing all CI dependencies now, and closing all running CI environments.
	Pushed updates to Git.

(#12)[5/18/2017-17:02 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Updated Gradle Builds.
	The Travis CI at least WORKS now... sort of. I don't think it's actually building/deploying anything, as every time gradle runs it just reports "UP-TO-DATE" for everything...
	Working and past builds can be viewed at https://travis-ci.org/Sergix/JTerm
	Edited the directories for the java package.
	Pushed updates to Git.

(#11)[5/18/2017-17:02 pre-alpha Sergix]

	Moved some directories around to hopefully work with the integrated builds.
	Pushed updates to Git.

(#9)[5/17/2017-22:03 pre-alpha Sergix]

(#4)[5/16/2017-19:09 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Finally reformatted the directory.
	Created a 'jterm' subfolder under /src that is used as the 'package' directory for eclipse.
	Class files are generated in the /src/jterm folder (the same folder as the source files).
	Went ahead and removed compile.bat, as it is now useless. :P
	Added some comments to JTerm.java for more explanation.
	Created a .gitignore for files. NOTE: zipped files (.rar, .zip) can no longer be uploaded. Create a separate branch for changes.
	Updated the README for a change in the "Changelog" section: changelog entries must be indented (as now shown.) This adds for better readability.
	Pushed updates to GitHub.

(#3)[5/16/2017-17:36 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Edited uploaded files by NCSGeek.
	Eclipse generated some weird files... gonna have to rework the directory.

(#2)[5/16/2017-17:05 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Created classpath and source directory.
	Created .vscode settings folder for VSCode preferences.
	compile.bat automatically builds classes and runs it in the console.
	Only issue at the moment is getting JARs to work for a console application, if it is even possible. Typically JARs are only used for GUI applications.
	Pushed updates to GitHub.

(#1)[5/15/2017-8:55 pre-alpha Sergix]
	Uploaded the global changelog file to the project.
	Changed README.md "Changelog" section to require username in changelog entries.
