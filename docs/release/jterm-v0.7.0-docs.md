The JTerm project is close to its official release, but the project has had enough changes to include it as a new pre-release version.

## New Features

### GUI
A new GUI interface has been added by @lbenedetto! It can run on any graphical interface and replicates the looks of a terminal, and functions in almost perfect unison with its terminal alternative. The GUI runs by default; if you would like to run without it, just specifify by running JTerm with the `headless` option.

### Commands
The `download`, `rmdir`, `mv`/`move`, `rn`, and 'regex' commands have been added by @nanoandrew4, @lbenedetto, and @ojles. These command specifications have been listed in the "Active Command List" section.
