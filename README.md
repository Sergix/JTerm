![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Sergix/JTerm.svg?branch=master)

## What is it?
A terminal written for cross-platform usage.

## Why will it help me?
Because the JTerm project is written in Java, this provides it various advantages:
- System compatibility downsides don't exist!
- Much safer than C++/C and other system languages

Plus, it's open source, so if you find any issues, you can help out everyone else using JTerm!

## Where do I get it?
Check the [releases](https://github.com/Sergix/JTerm/releases) page for binaries, as well as the source code. You can also look in the `/builds` directory for changelogs and other build-related stuff.
